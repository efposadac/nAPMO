Compilation
===========

At this moment there is a module in FORTRAN code. I used f2py to interface it with Python. To perform compilation just run:

* ``make``
* ``make clean`` is also supported.

One example using the code is provided in iphyton notebook format. (nAPMO-test.ipynb)

Any suggestion and help is more than welcome and appreciated.
