# Molecule definition:
# molecule [species name:charge:multiplicity]{}
# Charge is to add particles to the species, for instance,
# H- implies charge=1 because you are adding 1 e-

molecule [e-:1] {
    H  0.00 0.00 0.00
    E+ 0.00 0.00 0.00
}

# basis-set specification
# You must express the basis-set for species. 
# If you have only one species you can declare the basis-set as,
# basis = STO-3G

basis {
   e- CC-PVTZ
   E+ E+-H-7SP-AUG-CC-PVTZ
}

# SCF engine options the keyword means True even though you can
# express if you want it False or True, for instance:
# direct = False 

scf {
    maxiter = 1000
    hf
    hybrid = [e-:A, e+:N]
}

grid {
    e- [100, 110]    
    E+ [100, 110]

# You can add some operations in python syntax. 
# Here we compare the actual result "Energy" with the ref energy:

code {
result = lambda x: print("PASS!") if abs(x) < 1e-6  else print("FAILED!")
ref_energy = -0.662179920158
diff_energy = ref_energy - Energy
print(diff_energy)
result(diff_energy)
}
